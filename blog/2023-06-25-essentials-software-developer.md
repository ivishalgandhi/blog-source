Title: Essential Skills and Tools for a Software Developer Starting a Career in the IT Industry

## Introduction

Starting a career as a software developer in the fast-paced and ever-evolving IT industry can be both exciting and challenging. To thrive in this field, it is essential to equip yourself with the right skills, tools, and technologies. In this article, we will highlight key areas of focus that will help you establish a solid foundation as a software developer.

## Documentation

- ### Markdown 

Clear and concise documentation is crucial in software development. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text documentation. Mastering Markdown will enable you to create well-formatted README files, project documentation, and even blog articles like this one. Markdown is widely used in the industry, and it's a skill worth investing time in.

### Think of Documentation as a code

- Mermaid.js

Mermaid.js is a JavaScript library for generating diagrams and flowcharts from text. It is a powerful tool for creating visual representations of complex ideas and processes. Mermaid.js is easy to use and integrates well with Markdown. It is a valuable skill for software developers because it allows you to communicate ideas effectively and visually.

- Language Server Protocol

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a protocol that allows editors and IDEs to communicate with language servers. It is a powerful tool for building language-aware tools such as code completion, refactoring, and linting. LSP is widely used in the industry, and it's a skill worth investing time in.


1. REST API Knowledge

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style commonly used for web services. Understanding how REST APIs work and being able to design, build, and consume them is a fundamental skill for software developers. Learn about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL structure, request/response formats (JSON, XML), authentication, and common best practices for building RESTful APIs. This knowledge will empower you to interact with various web services and build robust and scalable applications.

3. Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in the IT industry. Familiarizing yourself with Linux is valuable because many development environments, servers, and cloud services are based on Linux. Gain proficiency in the command line interface (CLI), file navigation, package management, and shell scripting. Understanding Linux will enhance your ability to work with open-source solutions, deploy applications, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

4. Open Source Solutions

Embrace the open-source community as a software developer. Contributing to open-source projects not only allows you to collaborate with experienced developers but also helps you refine your coding skills. By studying open-source projects, you can learn about software architecture, coding standards, best practices, and gain exposure to different programming languages and frameworks. Explore popular open-source repositories such as GitHub and start contributing to projects aligned with your interests.

5. Productivity Note-Taking with Dendron, NB, and Markdown Files

Efficient note-taking is an essential habit for any developer. Dendron is a powerful note-taking system that allows you to organize and navigate your knowledge effectively. Use it to capture coding patterns, solutions to common problems, and snippets of code. Combine it with Markdown files and notebook tools like Jupyter Notebook (NB) to create well-structured and executable documentation. This approach will streamline your workflow and serve as a valuable resource for future reference.

6. Command Line Tools

Command line tools are an integral part of a developer's toolkit. Invest time in learning popular command line tools such as Git for version control, package managers like npm or pip, and task automation tools like Make or Gradle. Familiarize yourself with shell scripting to automate repetitive tasks and boost productivity. Proficiency in command line tools will make you more efficient and versatile in your day-to-day development activities.

7. Standard Way of Writing Solutions

Developers often encounter challenges in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Embrace standard practices and methodologies to overcome these challenges. For example, when building command-line interfaces (CLI), consider using libraries like docopt to create command-line interfaces with ease. When developing REST APIs, adhere to established standards such as the Richardson Maturity Model or OpenAPI specifications to ensure consistency and interoperability. These practices will make your code more robust, readable, and easier to maintain.

Conclusion

Embarking on a career as a software developer requires continuous learning and adaptation. By focusing on the key skills, tools
