## Documentation Skills

- Clear and concise documentation is crucial in software development. This includes not only code comments and README files, but also blog posts and articles that share your knowledge with others. 

Here are some key skills and tools to master:

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - A lightweight markup language that you can use to write easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to structurally valid HTML. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and writing articles on platforms like GitHub and Jekyll blogs.

- [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) - A JavaScript library that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts using text. It integrates well with Markdown, making it great for blog posts that need to explain complex ideas visually.

- [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) - A protocol developed by Microsoft that allows code editing tools to provide features like auto-complete, go to definition, find all references and alike without each tool needing to understand each programming language.

- [Diagram as a Code](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) - A Python library that allows you to create diagrams using code, which is great for prototyping a new system architecture design or explaining system design in your blog posts.

Remember, good documentation skills involve clear communication, good organization, and the ability to explain complex ideas in a simple, understandable way. Practice writing blog posts and articles to improve these skills. You can also contribute to open-source projects by writing documentation for them. Maintain documentation in tools like [Dendron](http://dendron.so), [Logseq](http://logseq.com) which is a powerful note-taking system that allows you to organize and navigate your knowledge effectively.

Once a big knowledge base is built, you can use it to capture coding patterns, solutions to common problems, and snippets of code. Combine it with Markdown files and notebook tools like Jupyter Notebook (NB) to create well-structured and executable documentation. This approach will streamline your workflow and serve as a valuable resource for future reference which can be used with Large Language Models to gain insights.

Consider all documentation as a code. Refer to my blog post [Documentation as Code](https://vishalgandhi.in/doc-as-code) for more information.

## REST API Knowledge

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style commonly used for web services. Understanding how REST APIs work and being able to design, build, and consume them is a fundamental skill for software developers. Learn about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL structure, request/response formats (JSON, XML), authentication, and common best practices for building RESTful APIs. This knowledge will empower you to interact with various web services and build robust and scalable applications.

In today's software development landscape, REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs have become a fundamental building block. They allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data over the internet. Most interfaces in software organizations are now through REST APIs, and it's nearly impossible to start any product without an "API First" approach.

Understanding how REST APIs work and being able to design, build, and consume them is a crucial skill for software developers. Learn about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL structure, request/response formats (JSON, XML), and authentication.

Here are some resources to get you started:

- [RESTful API Design](https://restfulapi.net/) - A comprehensive resource for understanding and designing RESTful APIs.
- [Building a RESTful API with Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) - A YouTube tutorial by Academind.
- [My Blog Post on REST API](https://vishalgandhi.in/rest-api-design-rules) - A deep dive into REST API from my personal experience and understanding.

In addition to understanding the principles of REST APIs, it's also important to familiarize yourself with some of the popular frameworks that can help you build REST APIs more efficiently:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/) - Gin is a web framework written in Go. It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to httprouter.

These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that simplify the process of building robust and scalable APIs. They handle a lot of the boilerplate code and allow you to focus on the business logic of your application.

Remember, a well-designed API can be a powerful tool for an organization, enabling it to expose its services to a variety of different clients and create new digital products and services.

## Linux knowledge

Familiarizing yourself with Linux is valuable because many development environments, servers, and cloud services are based on Linux. Gain proficiency in the command line interface (CLI), file navigation, package management, and shell scripting. Understanding Linux will enhance your ability to work with open-source solutions, deploy applications, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

To gain a deeper understanding of Linux, consider the following resources:

- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) - A free, self-guided tour to help you learn Linux.
- [The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Command-Line-Complete-Introduction/dp/1593273894) by William E. Shotts Jr. - This book is a comprehensive guide to using the command line to perform various tasks in Linux.

## Contribute to Open Source Solutions

Embrace the open-source community as a software developer. Contributing to open-source projects not only allows you to collaborate with experienced developers but also helps you refine your coding skills. By studying open-source projects, you can learn about software architecture, coding standards, best practices, and gain exposure to different programming languages and frameworks. Explore popular open-source repositories such as GitHub and start contributing to projects aligned with your interests.

Here are some resources to get you started:

- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) - A site dedicated to helping newcomers get started with contributing to open-source projects.
- [GitHub "Good First Issue" Label](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue) - GitHub's "Good First Issue" label is a great way to find projects that are beginner-friendly. These issues are specifically marked by project maintainers as good entry points for new contributors.

Remember, contributing to open source is not just about coding. You can contribute in many ways, including documentation, design, teaching, and more.

## Learn Standard Way of Writing Solutions

Developers often encounter challenges in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Embrace standard practices and methodologies to overcome these challenges.

For example, when building command-line interfaces (CLI), consider using libraries like docopt to create command-line interfaces with ease. 

Resources for CLI:
- [docopt](http://docopt.org/) - A command-line interface description language that will make you smile.
- [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/) - A guide to help you write command-line programs that respect the conventions of the Unix philosophy.

When developing REST APIs, adhere to established standards such as the Richardson Maturity Model or OpenAPI specifications to ensure consistency and interoperability. 

Resources for REST APIs:
- [Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) - A model (developed by Leonard Richardson) that breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps.
- [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) - A standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

These practices will make your code more robust, readable, and easier to maintain.

Resources for Clean Code:
- [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin - A book that describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.
